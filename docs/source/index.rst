Welcome to Vicious's documentation!
===================================

Vicious is a modular widget library for window managers, but mostly catering
to users of the `awesome window manager`_.  It was derived from the old
*wicked* widget library, and has some of the old *wicked* widget types,
a few of them rewritten, and a good number of new ones.

Vicious widget types are a framework for creating your own widgets.
Vicious contains modules that gather data about your system,
and a few *awesome* helper functions that make it easier to register timers,
suspend widgets and so on.  Vicious doesn't depend on any third party Lua_
library, but may depend on additional system utilities.
